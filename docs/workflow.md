## Communication plan:

- We created a Slack group and will be our primary communication channel;
- We will use zoom and remo to host our video conferences and mob program sessions. VS code live share will also be an option;
- We will use github project board as our project management repository;

## Conflict plan:

- In the event that we have different ideas and can’t come to an agreement, we will vote for the best idea. The idea with most votes will will. If the 3 of us have a different idea, we will engage the instructor to help bring clarity to the project;
- We will have a stand -up at the start of each day. During this time we will discuss ideas, review code, voting to solve conflicts, etc;
- We will talk to each other like professionals and respect one another;
- Work plan: How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
- Daily stand -up is key to go over what we did the day before and to talk and assign the new tasks that need to be completed that day;
- We will all work on it together and we will be adults, and we will all research the ideas that we like;
- We will utilize Github kanban board as our project management repository;

## Git process:

- What is your Git flow? How many people must review a PR? Who merges PRs? How often will you merge? How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
- We will create a DEV branch and this will be our ‘main’ branch for the project;
- We will create new branches when working on specific tasks. When the work is completed, we will create a pull request to the DEV Branch;
- PR to DEV will require 2 approvals;
- DEV will be merge into master at the end of each day, only when DEV has all working code;
- Anything else you feel is important: expectations around work times, stand-up times(outside of the ones schedule with the instructional team), taking breaks/seeking help when you’re stuck, etc;
- Expectation mon to thurs 630 to 930 and sat all day.
